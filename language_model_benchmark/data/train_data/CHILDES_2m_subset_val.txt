**MOT**: are you showing off over there \n\n **EXP**: now I'm gonna ask you some questions \n\n **MOT**: okay \n\n **EXP**: you did a good job \n\n **EXP**: alright so what was the first thing that he went to \n\n **EXP**: first toy do you remember \n\n **MOT**: um I showed him the bee \n\n **EXP**: mhm \n\n **MOT**: um I don't know what he went to on his own \n\n **MOT**: probably the keys \n\n **MOT**: or no actually the book I'm sorry \n\n **CHI**: yyy \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: does he play with so he went to the the bee that was like put together like that \n\n **MOT**: mhm \n\n **EXP**: um does he have any stuffed animals at home \n\n **MOT**: he was some but I keep a lot of them put up because they're like little stuff attached to them like his brother has \n\n **EXP**: mhm \n\n **MOT**: so I don't have a lot of the stuffed animals out just a couple \n\n **EXP**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: so he doesn't really play with those that much right now \n\n **EXP**: so why do you think he wanted to pick up that first \n\n **MOT**: this one \n\n **EXP**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: probably because it's different \n\n **MOT**: he probably doesn't see much something like this that often \n\n **EXP**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: and anything sticking up attracts him \n\n **MOT**: you_know the little antennas or the wings \n\n **EXP**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: you kicked your shoe off and your sock \n\n **EXP**: so so he liked he went to that bee and then he looked at the keys \n\n **MOT**: mhm \n\n **EXP**: does he have have this at home \n\n **MOT**: yeah he has them on a ring \n\n **MOT**: like the baby keys \n\n **CHI**: yyy \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: so that was familiar to him \n\n **MOT**: mhm \n\n **EXP**: because they're not on a ring like that it's they're just by themselves \n\n **MOT**: right but they they're shaped similar to this \n\n **MOT**: so it's probably why he they look familiar \n\n **MOT**: and he also has the teethers that look similar to that so maybe that's why he \n\n **CHI**: yyy \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: so and you said he also looked in the book \n\n **MOT**: mhm \n\n **EXP**: does he have that one at home \n\n **MOT**: we have one similar \n\n **MOT**: the Goodnight_Moon without the counting \n\n **MOT**: so we we have um it looks almost exactly like that from the front \n\n **CHI**: <UNK> \n\n **MOT**: so big \n\n **EXP**: do you have a lot of books at home \n\n **MOT**: yes \n\n **EXP**: is that something he \n\n **MOT**: mhm \n\n **MOT**: we read every night before we go to bed \n\n **MOT**: him and his brother and I \n\n **MOT**: we read \n\n **EXP**: um what was there anything that just was not interested anything that he did <UNK> \n\n **MOT**: he didn't really play with many of the stuffed animals I hadta introduce them to him \n\n **MOT**: um I showed him the clock and he kinda waved that around but he didn't really go to any of the food items at all \n\n **MOT**: um we have them at home so I don't know if maybe that's why \n\n **EXP**: mhm \n\n **MOT**: because he's seen them before \n\n **MOT**: because his brother has some of this stuff now \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: so I can't think of anything \n\n **EXP**: he didn't look at that <UNK> \n\n **MOT**: he didn't look at anything over here at all \n\n **MOT**: mhm \n\n **EXP**: usually at this age they are all over this stuff like on their mouths and everything \n\n **MOT**: yeah he put the well I I showed him the ice+creams and he put them in his mouth \n\n **MOT**: but I hadta show him um he's very concentrated when he plays he doesn't wander a lot \n\n **EXP**: mhm \n\n **MOT**: so it's funny he'll stick on the same thing for quite a while and we have a lot of toys in our playroom \n\n **MOT**: so he's very content with one or two things a lot of times \n\n **EXP**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: it looks like he likes that bee \n\n **MOT**: it's really cool isn't it \n\n **CHI**: <UNK> \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: so you don't do you have anything like that at home \n\n **MOT**: similar \n\n **MOT**: um we do have some like um like a pizza at home \n\n **MOT**: and bread \n\n **MOT**: um and he does play with the spoon a lot um at home \n\n **MOT**: so these should be familiar to him and we also go to the library where they have a fantasy area where he can play with this kind of stuff \n\n **MOT**: and we were actually there today looking at um like in a kitchen area \n\n **MOT**: so he's he's familiar with these items \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: here you go \n\n **EXP**: so do you think maybe he likes to play with that because he doesn't have \n\n **MOT**: I think maybe because and they're um anything that like looks um that sticks out he tends to draw his attention \n\n **MOT**: that he can play with with his fingers \n\n **MOT**: he's very fascinated with touching things \n\n **MOT**: so he likes to um you_know check things out a lot \n\n **MOT**: like he'll crawl across the room for a speck of leaf on the carpet \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: <UNK> \n\n **MOT**: yes he is \n\n **EXP**: um \n\n **MOT**: don't put it in your mouth \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: so do you remember the last visit when you did this same type of thing \n\n **MOT**: yes \n\n **EXP**: um are there any changes \n\n **MOT**: he's definitely a lot more um interested in new things \n\n **MOT**: I think before he was still a little younger \n\n **MOT**: and I in the last couple months he's definitely blossomed a lot more \n\n **MOT**: now that he can crawl he's out he'll he'll explore a lot more so I think um he definitely tries more than he did before \n\n **EXP**: mhm \n\n **MOT**: you playing peekaboo \n\n **MOT**: don't put it in your mouth \n\n **MOT**: good job \n\n **EXP**: so you would say that this time he looked at a lot more than he did \n\n **MOT**: I think so yeah \n\n **MOT**: because last time I I hadta really initiate it a lot more \n\n **EXP**: mhm \n\n **MOT**: and so I think this time he um \n\n **MOT**: even though I'd initiate some this time he was a lot more interested on his own and try to crawl up and play with things that he wouldn't have before \n\n **EXP**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: and what about the doll \n\n **EXP**: that was not really \n\n **MOT**: doesn't interest him \n\n **MOT**: it didn't this time at all \n\n **EXP**: mhm \n\n **MOT**: I dunno it's because we don't have them at home \n\n **EXP**: yeah he has a brother you said \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: and he I_mean he goes over to somebody's house to play that's a girl but I don't know if they even play with it there that much \n\n **MOT**: you're so big \n\n **MOT**: you're so into you're so big \n\n **EXP**: so what do you think \n\n **EXP**: you said you read to him every night \n\n **EXP**: what do you think he prefers books or toys \n\n **MOT**: um \n\n **EXP**: he likes the reading the books or \n\n **MOT**: I I think it's probably about the same but I think in general he seemed to like the toys a little more \n\n **EXP**: mhm \n\n **EXP**: um and do you think at this point um as opposed to different from last time that he recognizes the names of some of these items more \n\n **EXP**: like some of the animals \n\n **MOT**: he may \n\n **MOT**: um I haven't really sat down with him lately and and had a lot of one on one time with him \n\n **MOT**: um so that's probably not as good as it could be \n\n **EXP**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: potty training his brother has been a been a new priority lately so \n\n **EXP**: oh so they're close in age \n\n **MOT**: yeah his brother's three \n\n **EXP**: oh \n\n **MOT**: and he's ten months so they're just a little over two years apart \n\n **EXP**: okay \n\n **EXP**: um so do you think that there's anything else that you just noticed about this play session that you might wanna add that anything that was like maybe surprised you about what he liked to look at or what he wasn't interested in \n\n **MOT**: no this is

**EXP**: guess I can ask you some questions now \n\n **MOT**: okay \n\n **EXP**: since you've been playing for a while \n\n **EXP**: I wasn't really looking at him too much \n\n **EXP**: so I'm not sure what he liked best \n\n **EXP**: um out of these \n\n **EXP**: but these look more spread out than these so that's what I'm guessing \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: I think definitely um he went for the clock again and the food stuff \n\n **EXP**: and the food \n\n **EXP**: uhhuh \n\n **MOT**: excuse me \n\n **MOT**: yes \n\n **MOT**: specifically these peas \n\n **MOT**: I don't know why \n\n **EXP**: especially those \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: did he like anything else um foodwise \n\n **MOT**: he liked this \n\n **CHI**: yyy \n\n **MOT**: was it th this one or the red one \n\n **MOT**: was more um \n\n **EXP**: this one \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: and then I don't know if it was color choice or not but \n\n **MOT**: and then he liked this cookie once I showed it to him \n\n **MOT**: but he hasn't really had cookies yet I_mean I just think maybe the multiple colors \n\n **EXP**: the colors mhm \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: the measuring spoons he liked the way that jingled \n\n **MOT**: didn't I tried to get him interested in the stuffed animals to see \n\n **MOT**: and he didn't show any interest really \n\n **EXP**: I thought you were doing the rooster I thought he would like that \n\n **MOT**: but he didn't show too um \n\n **MOT**: he didn't seem to \n\n **EXP**: not really \n\n **MOT**: didn't spark anything with him this time \n\n **EXP**: looks like he's found it again \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: he really likes that \n\n **MOT**: yeah and I I_mean I haven't looked for anything similar to that but \n\n **EXP**: I remember last time he liked that right \n\n **MOT**: <UNK> \n\n **MOT**: he did \n\n **MOT**: and then when we asked him you_know when I said \n\n **MOT**: where's the clock \n\n **MOT**: h h he went toward it \n\n **MOT**: but this time he didn't seem to really register the way it did the first time \n\n **EXP**: <UNK> \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: was that the main thing that he liked last time \n\n **EXP**: I'm trying to remember \n\n **MOT**: yes yes \n\n **MOT**: he just stayed with that for the longest time \n\n **EXP**: okay \n\n **EXP**: and now he's found \n\n **EXP**: oh look it he's trying a lot of things huh \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **MOT**: and he likes to just pick things up and throw them to see how they sound when they land like that \n\n **MOT**: you_know these things are heavier \n\n **MOT**: and I could see that he was like \n\n **MOT**: huh \n\n **EXP**: right \n\n **MOT**: that made a different thud instead of the the peas that were so light \n\n **EXP**: uhhuh \n\n **EXP**: so do you think he likes them for that reason \n\n **EXP**: so ju different things they're different weights and they sound different \n\n **MOT**: I think that's what he likes to experiment with is yeah \n\n **MOT**: just seeing how they \n\n **EXP**: what gravity does huh \n\n **MOT**: like what happens when I do this right \n\n **EXP**: yeah your little science <UNK> \n\n **MOT**: haha \n\n **EXP**: did he try any of the books today \n\n **MOT**: he didn't \n\n **MOT**: I got the peekababy out \n\n **MOT**: and he didn't seem to even recognize what I was trying to read \n\n **EXP**: okay okay \n\n **EXP**: oh I know you tried with \n\n **MOT**: I tried the kangaroo \n\n **EXP**: kangaroo \n\n **EXP**: that's it \n\n **MOT**: and the chicken or rooster \n\n **EXP**: no interest there \n\n **EXP**: okay \n\n **MOT**: no \n\n **MOT**: he didn't like pitcher until I put something in there \n\n **EXP**: oh \n\n **MOT**: it made a sound \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: made a sound \n\n **MOT**: that was \n\n **EXP**: so he didn't \n\n **MOT**: that was that that he liked \n\n **MOT**: and but he you_know when he got it out then he didn't want the pitcher anymore \n\n **EXP**: uhhuh \n\n **MOT**: he didn't wanna try to put it back in like \n\n **EXP**: uhhuh \n\n **MOT**: sometimes he might \n\n **EXP**: balance out huh \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: it does \n\n **EXP**: you found the clock again I know \n\n **EXP**: um let's see \n\n **EXP**: if or at home maybe um if you're reading a book with him \n\n **EXP**: would he rather turn the pages himself or does he like you to to sort of do that \n\n **MOT**: he wants to hold the book \n\n **EXP**: he wants to hold it okay \n\n **CHI**: right \n\n **MOT**: what I found yesterday was that the best thing was for him to be in his highchair haha \n\n **MOT**: to try to read because otherwise he's grabbing it \n\n **MOT**: and depending on you_know these pages books are fine but the thinner ones he would just be tearing at this point so \n\n **EXP**: mhm \n\n **MOT**: but he wants to be \n\n **EXP**: he wants to be in control of that \n\n **MOT**: exactly \n\n **EXP**: uhhuh \n\n **EXP**: and would you say he likes toys better at this point than books \n\n **MOT**: definitely mhm \n\n **EXP**: okay \n\n **EXP**: um does he play with any dolls at home \n\n **MOT**: he hasn't \n\n **MOT**: and my daughter has a lot \n\n **MOT**: but he hasn't he's gone toward her favorite doll a few times but I think it's only because she plays with it so much \n\n **MOT**: I don't really think \n\n **EXP**: it's not so so much that it's a doll \n\n **MOT**: right I mean all the out of all these dolls he didn't go for that \n\n **MOT**: he wanted to play with this doll's eyes a little bit \n\n **MOT**: and touch the mouth and the nose \n\n **MOT**: but I don't think he was really \n\n **MOT**: I don't I don't think dolls are his interest area now \n\n **EXP**: okay \n\n **EXP**: um so would you say that I know it's not the food toys but the animals or the books interested him the least this visit \n\n **EXP**: which one was sort of least interesting \n\n **MOT**: um I would say the books would be the least interesting this time \n\n **EXP**: okay \n\n **MOT**: I_mean it seemed like I sparked a little bit of interest with the puppet and the r chicken but not \n\n **MOT**: and the books I_mean I may as well have not been saying anything \n\n **MOT**: didn't seem to do anything with those \n\n **MOT**: and which kinds of toys do you think are good for his personality \n\n **MOT**: the stuff that has an effect like when he's shaking the the um teaspoons or the measuring spoons \n\n **MOT**: he can hear a reaction \n\n **EXP**: mhm \n\n **MOT**: so um at home there's a little play piano \n\n **MOT**: so he likes to po I_mean he's not playing it \n\n **MOT**: but he likes to pound on it because he knows that it makes a sound \n\n **MOT**: um I don't know \n\n **EXP**: does he have any of those toys that um you push a button and something pops up \n\n **MOT**: yes \n\n **MOT**: he like he likes those \n\n **MOT**: he likes things there's a \n\n **EXP**: so cause and effect \n\n **MOT**: cause and effect kinda thing \n\n **MOT**: where he's you press a button and plays music \n\n **MOT**: or I can't rememb it's something that you can hang on the side of a crib \n\n **MOT**: but we don't use it for that \n\n **MOT**: um but there's a little um dial that you can turn \n\n **MOT**: and like these two gears turn \n\n **MOT**: so he likes to see that happen \n\n **MOT**: um yeah push and pull kinda stuff \n\n **MOT**: anything that he can hit to make a sound or \n\n **EXP**: okay \n\n **EXP**: fair enough huh \n\n **MOT**: yeah and the kitchen my ah our play kitchen's in the basement \n\n **MOT**: but he would be all over this stuff too if he could just \n\n **MOT**: whatever he can shake and \n\n **EXP**: whatever's making noise \n\n **EXP**: yyy \n\n **MOT**: move or press buttons \n\n **MOT**: right \n\n **EXP**: does he <UNK> \n\n **MOT**: pounds things together all the time \n\n **MOT**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: because he was trying to do that with something there \n\n **EXP**: um and it didn't make much of a noise \n\n **MOT**: I think it was the two peas \n\n **MOT**: it was like the peas and something \n\n **EXP**: yeah \n\n **EXP**: and it didn't really didn't really do anything for him because it didn't make a noise \n\n **MOT**: right \n\n **MOT**: right so you s you skipped that and went on to something else huh \n\n **MOT**: do you think he recognizes the names or any of the like food items or the utensils or any of the animal names yet \n\n **MOT**: no \n\n **MOT**: no um you_know I filled out that form and I said you_know I don't know if he's sposta know any of this stuff but he doesn't \n\n **MOT**: I_mean we \n\n **EXP**: no no there's no they're so variable at this age their interests what um \n\n **EXP**: there's nothing that he's sposta be doing that we have here \n\n **EXP**: it's just sort of looking at what he wants \n\n **MOT**: of interest \n\n **MOT**: yeah I I can't say that like last time we we che we said like \n\n **MOT**: Lucas find the clock \n\n **MOT**: he didn't um I_mean he went for it <UNK> and that totally surprised me \n\n **EXP**: okay \n\n **EXP**: because he seemed to know the name of it then \n\n **MOT**: but yeah \n\n **MOT**: and I think there are random things \n\n **MOT**: like I think he knows milk now but not any of the \n\n **MOT**: I I don't think I could say to him you_know \n\n **MOT**: get the book \n\n **MOT**: or get the \n\n **EXP**: if you um I think the reason we may be asking that is just that if he did know some of the names and you said the name would he be more likely to go get that than if he didn't recognize any of those names and was just playing so you_know \n\n **MOT**: no no sweetie \n\n **EXP**: that's it it's just
